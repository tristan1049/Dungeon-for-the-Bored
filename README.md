# Dungeon-for-the-Bored
A mini Dungeon Crawler game I made when I was bored. Currently involves different dice, items, and enemies. Made in and runs on Spyder as it interacts with the console of IDE's to take input and create illustrations. Utilizes Object Oriented Programming to create the player of the game with items and attributes, and serializes the games played so that they can be picked up again later, so long as you survive...

To play, run:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`python3 Interface.py`
